# Medi-ID
Medi ID is a bracelet that contains NFC technology which directs the user to a progressive website containing the medical information of a patient. The progressive website is developed using PHP scripts. The user taps the bracelet on their phone to access the website, logging in with predetermined credentials. This repository contains the contents of the project, including documentation and source code of the project. The project must use the physical Medi ID bracelet to properly demo the project, but the link that the bracelet redirects the user can be found here: https://mediid.000webhostapp.com/login_form.php
